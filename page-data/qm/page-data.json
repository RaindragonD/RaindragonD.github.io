In the first post, we introduce the Stern-Gerlach experiment, which leads to the discovery of spin, a fundamental quantum mechanical nature of elementary particles. We then lay out the postulates of the QM. Finally, we introduce the Dirac notation, the mathematical notation we used in QM."},"excerpt":"This is the first post of the Introduction to Quantum Mechanics series.
